title: Our Values
---

We believe that government should be:

*   **Open**: transparent, genuinely representative and accountable, with no hiding place for backroom influence.
*   **Democratic**: that democracy should constantly evolve to ensure citizens develop new opportunities to hold the establishment to account, and ensuring this should be a core function of Government.
*   **Rational**: with decisions and policy based on sound and scientific evidence.
*   **Courageous**: able to make difficult long-term decisions without pandering to short-termism.
*   **Ethical**: dedicated to creating a sustainable environment, society and economy with progressive moral values, working first and foremost for the benefit of all its citizens rather than for the wealthiest.
*   **Internationalist**: delivering co-ordinated trade, defence, development and foreign policies that openly reflect our values.

We believe that individuals should be:

*   **Free** to act in any manner that does not harm another individual, and does not infringe upon the rights of other individuals.
*   Enjoy a fundamental right to **privacy** from the state or its agents.
*   **Equal** and free from discrimination or harm on the basis of their sex, sexuality, disability, race or religion; and that a paradigm shift in attitudes is needed to achieve this.
