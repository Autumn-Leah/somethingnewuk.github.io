The European Union is cause for celebration throughout the world. With the forming of the EU, conflict turned to co-operation, peaceful progress replaced bloodshed.

In recent years the rise of nationalist parties (like UKIP, Front National, Golden Dawn, National Democratic Party, Finns, Danish People's Party, Party for Freedom, Jobbik, Austrian Freedom and Lega Nord) has sewn new and disturbing division amongst Europe's democracies. Their campaign of fear and hatred of others is polarising populations and threatening the peace that helped deliver Europe from decades of war.

David Cameron is himself responsible for sewing some of that divison with his anti-EU rhetoric. We were told this week that he has secured a "new deal" for Britain in Europe. So what did he get?

1. Britain is no longer tied to the principle of "ever-closer union". In other words, Britain is now declaring itself uninterested in furthering the peaceful coalition that has existed between European states. Thanks Dave(!)
1. It's now possible for any member state to **ask for permission** to suspend benefit payments to non-nationals EU migrants for 7 years **if** the member state can demonstrate that such benefits are too high a burden on the state. Whether or not you agree with this "benefits ban" (we don't), demonstrating that burden is going to prove difficult for Cameron given [UK nationals are more of a "burden" on the welfare state than EU migrants](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/05/eu-migrants-uk-gains-20bn-ucl-study).
1. Europe's financial centre - London - and the huge multinational banks that base themselves there are feeling threatened by the potential of the European Union to introduce rules that would curtail the cavalier attitude of the bankers that have already proved themselves irresponsible. Cameron has secured a method of at least delaying such measures, building on top of the repeated attempts by Tory MEPs to stop bankers being helf to account and made to be more responsible with the immense power they still yield.

This is nothing to celebrate.

And it does nothing to address the genuine issues about the European Union that need to be addressed.

Something New is blessed with both europhiles and eurosceptics amongst our membership. Far from the "division" that the media would like you to think that sews, as they do with Labour and the Tories, it brings us a broad range of perspectives. Our unique approach to building a political party means we respect diverse opinions, embrace them, and work together towards a common aim.

[Our manifesto](https://somethingnew.org.uk/manifesto/foreign_policy#european-union) is clear on the European Union; it's a force for good but with problems. We need to fix the democratic deficit, reform wasteful and damaging policies and end the anti-democratic actions that force countries to adopt austerity and perpetuate poverty.

Being outside the EU won't stop austerity at home, protect workers rights, stop the privatisation of national assets like the NHS or end the shameful funding of weapons of mass destruction while child poverty increases. In fact, there are countless EU rules and measures that force our national government to work in our interests rather than against them.

Leaving the European Union will be a blessing to neoliberals like Nigel Farage and David Cameron who believe that the "free market" is more important than equality, human rights and liberty. Brexit would result in more privatisation, further undermining of human rights and the erosion of our civil liberties thanks to an electoral system that fails to represent the will of the people.

We must stay in a reformed Europe, but not the selfish, corporate-driven "reform" of David Cameron and his party financiers. We must stay in a reformed Europe that works for the betterment of it's citiens through real democratic mandate.

Join us, vote **YES** on 23rd June, and help make it happen.
