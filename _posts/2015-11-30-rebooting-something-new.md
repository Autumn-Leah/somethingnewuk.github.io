It's been 207 days since 7th May, when the Conservatives won a flimsy five-seat
majority, and Something New stood in their first general election. In that time,
the Conservatives have been busy, with everything from crushing our civil liberties, to dampening our right to strike and cutting thousands of pounds from working families. And that's just the start of it.

In the May general election, Something New won 695 votes, no mean feat for a brand new party. Paul Robinson also stood for Waverley Borough Council and for Godalming Town Council, along with his wife, Rebecca. On 11 June, we stood a candidate, Jessie Macneil-Brown, in a by-election on Tower Hamlets London Borough Council, winning 40 votes. With so many elections in such a short space of time for such a small team, we had to take a break.

Having rested, recuperated and gathered our thoughts following the general election and the Labour leadership election, we are preparing to re-open the conversation about the future of British democracy. And we want you to talk to us, literally, [on our forum](http://discourse.somethingnew.org.uk).

We still have a [number of openings](/news/2015/05/11/expanding-the-something-new-team.html) in the Something New team that we want to fill. These include: Community Manager, Campaigns Officer, Communications Officer and Treasurer. Our former Campaigns Officer and Treasurer, Alex Hilton, has since rejoined the Labour Party and we wish him all the best. Lindsey Garrett, who was intending to stand as London Mayor earlier this year has also moved on for her own reasons, and we similarly wish her well. But, that leaves us a little shorthanded.

So we want you to join us here at Something New in shaping the future of not only democracy, but also our nation. We want ideas, and we want your enthusiasm for what a better future. We want people to [contribute to our manifesto](/manifesto/index.html), to design fantastic leaflets and graphics, to stand in elections, and much more besides. If you think you want to get involved, do not hesitate to head over to our [Support](/support.html) page for more information and to get in touch.
