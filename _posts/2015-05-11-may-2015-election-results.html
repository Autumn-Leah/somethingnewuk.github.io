<p>So, the May 2015 election season is over, and it's time to look at our results. Something New stood three candidates in various elections, and while we didn't win any seats (all our elections were swept by Conservative candidates), we're pretty pleased
  with our results:</p>

<p>These are quite obviously not big numbers, but for a small party in its first election, contesting strongly Conservative seats, we're pretty pleased. We've done better than almost all the other small parties and independents we've been working alongside,
  and that's with a bare minimum of time and money.</p>
<p>In all cases, we contributed positively to the election debate, and tried to inject a bit of optimism and vision into what was otherwise an extremely negative election campaign. This election was about us getting our ideas out in front of people, and
  everyone that we've heard from reacted very positively, even if that didn't translate into actual votes.</p>
<p>I think we've got something worth building on here, and that's exactly what we're going to do. There is a desire growing for a new type of democracy, and the challenge for the coming years is to unify that desire into a strong political movement that
  can deliver better results next time and force real change. These results show that Something New has a big contribution to make to that movement, and I hope we can use this as a springboard to a better future for everyone.</p>
<p>At the same time, there are more elections to fight. Jessie Macneil-Brown will be standing in the Stepney Green council by-election in June, and we are already making plans for the London elections next year.</p>
<p>Of course, movements are nothing without people, so if you're frustrated at the election result, <a href="/volunteer">join us and help build something positive for the future</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who supported us, helped us, voted for us, donated to the campaigns, and more. Onwards!</p>
