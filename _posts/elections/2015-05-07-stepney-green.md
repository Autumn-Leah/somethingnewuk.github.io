On June 11th Stepney Green in Tower Hamlets is electing a new Councillor in a by-election. 

I’ve lived in Tower Hamlets for 10 years and I’m fed up of the infighting between Labour and Tower Hamlets First. Instead of corruption and ego politics I want  to see a focus on delivering for local people.

I’ve never been a politician but I want to fight town hall corruption and make sure residents have a strong voice with developers like Crossrail. I want Rent Control and investment in truly affordable housing that local people can afford. I want the best education for local young people and an end to the racial profiling we see with the police and ticket inspectors.

## Who is Jessie?

Jessie is a senior campaigner for an international human rights NGO. She has also been a local activist helping people stand up to Crossrail. Jessie’s never been in politics before we think she’s just the sort of person who ought to be.

## What will Jessie fight for?

*   Tackling Town Hall corruption
*   Standing up to developers
*   Housing that local people can afford
*   Rent control
*   The best education for local young people
*   Safer streets
*   End to racial profiling by the police and ticket inspectors
