I'm [Paul Robinson](https://twitter.com/pauljrobinson), a local business-owner and Godalming resident who wants to protect our greenbelt, our natural environment and vastly improve our transportation system. I also want to improve how we do politics in this country, and make it far more representative, especially for younger people. I hope you'll [get involved](/support.html) too, and consider standing for election where you live.

### We believe in:

*   building a sustainable and progressive society for everyone's future, where nobody is left behind
*   an open, transparent and accountable government which protects the privacy of its citizens
*   taking the right decisions for the long term, not just tomorrow's papers
*   rational and evidence-based policy-making, with less room for special interests and lobbying

### In SW Surrey and Waverley we want to:

*   provide considerable more affordable housing using existing brownfield sites, and by building upwards before we ever build out into our valuable greenbelt
*   improve roads by making it safer to cycle or walk to our local schools or into town centres
*   provide a bus service from each town that goes direct to the Royal Surrey Hospital 
*   increase the frequency of weekend train services 
*   defend our countryside from the industrial fracking of shale oil and gas
*   ensure any increases in Councillor's allowances are directly linked to wage increases paid to Council employees
*   have access to greater powers pushed down to local government via a fully devolved English Parliament within a federal UK
