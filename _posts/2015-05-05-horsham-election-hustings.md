Still making up your mind who to vote for in Horsham? Wish you knew what your candidates had to say on various matter? Well, we've had three public election hustings events here over the last few weeks, and now all the videos are up online.

We've had the CPRE "Countryside or Concrete" hustings, the Horsham Churches Together hustings mostly on social issues, and the West Sussex Humanists hustings on science, freedom of speech, and so on. Watch all the events right here:
