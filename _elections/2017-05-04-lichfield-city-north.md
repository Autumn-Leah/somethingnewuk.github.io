## Meet Philip John

On 4th May, Lichfield is electing new councillors to Staffordshire County Council.

I’ve lived in Lichfield for over 11 years and I’m fed up of the same old political choices on the ballot paper. Electing a county counillor is important - the county takes care of things like schools, health and social care, and roads.

My decision to stand as a candidate was based on a desire for people to have more choices than the same parties who too often only appear around election time. People keep telling me they want a different choice, and they want a visible representative. That's what I'm here to be.

## Who is Phil?

Phil is a local web developer and father. He has lived in Lichfield for 11 years since moving from just over the border in Warwickshire. He has long been involved in the local community, helping to run volunteer community news website Lichfield Live, spent several years helping to organise the famous Lichfield Fuse Festival, been an active participant of the Lichfield Chamber of Trade and Commerce, sat on the Lichfield Town Team, helped to lay the groundwork for the successful Lichfield Business Improvement District and helped many other local projects, such as We Love Lichfield, through his expertise as a web developer. When not working from home or in one of Lichfield’s many lovely cafes, Phil enjoys craft beer, mountain biking on Cannock Chase and days out with his two children.

## What will Phil fight for?

* An end to the needless and ideological austerity cuts,
* No more council tax rises while services are cut,
* Protecting our state schools from forced academisation and making sure local academies aren’t being used to line the pockets of their sponsors,
* Ensuring the independence of our emergency services, free from political interference,
* Making sure Staffordshire’s people, organisations and businesses get the support they need from the council, not excuses.
