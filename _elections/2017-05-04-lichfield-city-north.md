## Meet Philip John

On 4th May, Lichfield is electing new councillors to Staffordshire County Council.

I’ve lived in Lichfield for over 11 years and I’m fed up of the same old political choices on the ballot paper. Electing a county councillor is important - the county takes care of things like schools, health and social care, and roads.

My decision to stand as a candidate was based on a desire for people to have more choices than the same parties who too often only appear around election time. People keep telling me they want a different choice, and they want a visible representative. That's what I'm here to be.

## What will Phil fight for?

* An end to the needless and ideological austerity cuts,
* No more council tax rises while services are cut,
* Protecting our state schools from forced academisation and making sure local academies aren’t being used to line the pockets of their sponsors,
* Ensuring the independence of our emergency services, free from political interference,
* Making sure Staffordshire’s people, organisations and businesses get the support they need from the council, not excuses.

## How will Phil represent you?

* Everything Phil does as a councillor will go onto [his blog](https://medium.com/@something_phil) so you can see what he's up to.
* You'll also be able to sign up to a mailing list to hear about the work Phil is doing.
* Phil will keep you updated via his [Twitter](https://twitter.com/something_phil) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/somethingnewlichfield/).
* Plus, you can call him on 07516 816 273.
* Every three months, Phil will try to visit every household in the area to talk about local issues and hand out leaflets detailing what he's been doing for you.
* If you want him to, Phil will happily come visit you to talk about specific issues or concerns - just call him!

## Who is Phil?
