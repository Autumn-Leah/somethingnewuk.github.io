I'm James Smith, a programmer, father, and local resident, with strong interests in science, technology and sustainability. I'm standing for Parliament in the 2017 general election because I think we need new choices, and an optimistic vision of the future.

### Something New believes in:

*   Using the best ideas, by building the world's first [open-source political manifesto](/manifesto) that _you_ can add to.
*   Building a sustainable and progressive society for everyone, where nobody is left behind.
*   An open, transparent and accountable government which protects the privacy of its citizens.
*   Taking the right decisions for the long term, not just tomorrow's papers.
*   Rational and evidence-based policy-making, with less room for special interests and lobbying. 

### Local issues:

*   Support renewable energy instead of fracking or oil drilling.
*   Oppose expansion of Gatwick Airport (or others) due to climate harm.
*   Encourage reform and transparency in Horsham District Council.
*   Help communities plan the right housing developments for their needs, not just object to imposed plans.
