[James Smith](/people/james-smith) ran a practical workshop and talk about Something New and the open source manifesto. We got a load of policy suggestions submitted during the session, and a good number were accepted by the voters!

## Talk Description

> This is a practical session where interested people can come together to discuss the ideas of open source politics, work together on policy ideas, and maybe even boot up a new political movement for the 21st century. We'll also present some experiences from running on an open source platform in the 2015 general election. We had an unscheduled discussion workshop at the last EMFcamp, and the tent we borrowed was absolutely rammed, so be sure to arrive early!
