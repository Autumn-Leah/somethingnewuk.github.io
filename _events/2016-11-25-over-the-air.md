[James Smith](/people/james-smith) is speaking at Over The Air, the popular technology conference, about open source democracy. His talk starts at 11.30am on the first day of the two-day conference.

## Talk Description

> We are building a networked society, a change potentially as significant as the industrial revolution, and with technological change comes social change. We need to keep iterating our democracy to allow us to make decisions together in an ever more connected world, we need new political choices that reflect those ideals, and we all need to build them together. This talk will cover experiments in open source democracy, experience of standing in the 2015 general election, and the way ahead for a new political movement built around openness.
