[James Smith](/people/james-smith) gave a talk on the Forum stage at the Secret Garden Party festival about his experiences of standing for election in May, and why he did it.

## Talk Description

> Our democracy has to change to be fit for the 21st century. Frustrated by the lack of decent political choices, James started a wikipedia-style manifesto project, and formed a new party to stand for election in May. This is the story of what he did, why, what happened along the way, and what happens next.
