[James Smith](/people/james-smith) presented Something New and the story of the 2015 general election to the Horsham Skeptics in the Pub group.

## Talk Description

> British democracy isn’t quite dead, but it certainly smells funny. Frustrated with politics and the lack of choice, and despite having no political experience at all, we created a wikipedia-style political manifesto and formed a new party to stand in the 2015 general election. This is the story of what we did, why we did it, what happened along the way, and what we learned. Government isn’t just for some special class of people; our democracy needs updating for the 21st century, so where does it go from here and how do we make it better?
