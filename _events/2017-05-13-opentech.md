[James Smith](/people/james-smith) is giving a talk again at OpenTech 2017.

> Our democracy isn't a finished system; we can keep on improving it, iterating it. But it's not just about better access to the same choices; "Open" is a political statement, and is becoming a new political movement for the future. The OpenPolitics project takes ideas from the open source and agile movements, and applies them to collaborative policymaking online, building the world's first open source political manifesto, built on top of modern technologies like Git, but making them friendly enough that anyone can get involved. This talk will explore how it works, and most importantly why it's worth doing.
