[James Smith](/people/james-smith) gave a talk titled "Open Source Democracy" as part of the UK Parliament's Exploring Digital series of internal seminars.

## Talk Description

 > Over the last few decades the open source movement has created new ways of collaborating across the Internet to build complex systems. Can we apply those ideas to our democracy? What is the potential for a 21st century networked form of politics? The Open Politics project has built a manifesto using open source principles, and stood in the 2015 General Election under the Something New banner. This talk will explain how we built our platform, and what happened when we took it to the people.
