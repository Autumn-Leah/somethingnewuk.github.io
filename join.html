          Because we want everyone to be able to take part, you don't have to 
          pay anything if you don't want to. <a href="https://subscriptions.zoho.com/subscribe/8cef313466ac657e4c0370e9ea55ae6f6a2bba0f6b053217afe8ded60e8a6aa6/monthly-membership">Click here</a> to join without setting
          up a donation. Unfortunately our membership system needs payment details even for free memberships, but you won't be charged anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're not a UK registered voter, choose this option as we
          can't accept your donation anyway.

<h3>FAQs</h3>

<h4>It's free? How does that work?</h4>
<p>
We believe everyone in the UK should be able to take part in building a better 
democracy, so membership of Something New is completely free. Intead, we ask that
you set up a regular donation when you join to help support our costs.
</p>

<h4>What do I get?</h4>
<p>
Everything we do is open to all; there is nothing special that members get access to.
Instead it's about making a statement, and helping to build a better future. You will need
to be a member if you want to stand for election or as a party officer, though.
</p>

<h4>I'm already a member of the X party, can I join?</h4>
<p>
We don't mind if you are a member of another party - in fact, we encourage collaboration!
Your other party might have a problem with it though; check their rules.
