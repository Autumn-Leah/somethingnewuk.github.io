title: Our guarantee
---

We think it's important for you to know exactly what you're getting when you join us, or when you vote for one of our candidates. Openness is listed as the first of our core values, and that's why we guarantee:

*   to make all our policy in public, through an [Open Manifesto](http://www.openpolitics.org.uk "Open Manifesto") to which anyone can contribute.
*   to never have a party whip, and to allow all representatives to vote freely.
*   to only revoke membership or candidacy from someone if they clearly violate [our values](/our_values.html).
*   to publish every last detail of our [party funding](http://somethingnewuk.github.io/finances), connections and meetings with external lobby groups.
