      title: Set up a regular donation
      description: |
        Making a regular monthly donation to Something New really helps us pay for web services, and build up a fighting fund for elections.
        
        We publish [basic details of all donations](http://somethingnew.org.uk/about/finances/horsham/donations.html) openly, so be sure you're OK with that before you donate, and that you're on the UK electoral roll.

        All our policy is crowdsourced, and you can easily add your own ideas in just a few minutes:

        1. Head over to [the manifesto](/manifesto)
        2. Find the area where you want to add your idea
        3. Hit "Make a change" at the top right, and sign up for an account if necessary
        4. Write your idea
        5. Hit the "Submit changes" button at the bottom, follow the instructions, and you're done!

        After that, the existing authors will decide if it goes into the main manifesto, and if it does, you get to vote next time! Democracy in action!

        Local papers are always after letters to publish. Why not write to express your disappointment with our current political options, and mention that we're trying to do things differently? Normally you can just send an email, so this doesn't take long!

        Why not write a blog post or article about us, or generally on your thoughts about democracy and how we can do it better? Make sure you share it far and wide, of course, and let us know so we can do the same!

      title: Transcribe our videos and podcasts
      icon: fa-video-camera
      description: |
        Isn't it annoying when you can't search what politicians and candidates say in person? We think so. 
        
        That's why we want to use [SayIt](http://somethingnew.sayit.mysociety.org) to publish transcripts of our talks 
        and podcasts. If you fancy it, you can transcribe something from the list below, either straight into the 
        site, or just write it into a document and send it over to [info@somethingnew.org.uk](mailto:info@somethingnew.org.uk). 
        
        Most things are about half an hour long, but it'll probably take longer to transcribe unless you're a whiz with 
        a shorthand keyboard.
        
        All the links below need transcribing, so pick one and get started!
