## Policies
    
### Are you left, right, or centre?

No. And yes.

OK, serious answer. We don't think left and right are useful terms in modern politics (and think you'll have a hard time finding anyone who really does). The old parties that sit on that dimension are split, and honestly, today they don't mean much more than which football team you support. We think there are new dimensions appearing in politics. We are **open** rather than closed, **internationalist** rather than localist, and want the future to work for **everyone**, not just the few. We're not left or right, but forward.

### What are your most important policies?

The best way to get a flavour of what we believe is to look at the principles on the [front page](/), and the [manifesto](/manifesto) covers a huge range of policy, but a few important areas are:
  
  * **Rebalance the economy**. Our economy is a tool for society, not its master. Financial inequality is a bad thing for society, and we want to build an economy that ensures everyone can meet their basic needs while still allowing for free enterprise and innovation, and at the same time coping with ever-increasing automation of skilled and unskilled labour. We think that a [Universal Basic Income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income) will be an important part of this change.
  * **Serious action on climate change** and other existential threats. We are a planetary-scale civilisation with planetary-sized problems. We have to work together as a species to solve them, and we have to solve them quickly if we're going to make it through to a glorious future. We need to take decisive action to shift to a zero-carbon economy as soon as possible.
  * **Democratic reform**. That's both short term to make our democracy more representative of the public's views, and long term to build a truer democracy through better methods of participation and modern technology (i.e. [liquid or delegative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy)).
  * **Protect civil liberties and human rights**. Basic rights that we grant to everyone, unconditionally, are what make us an advanced civilisation. We can't forget those basic rights and liberties when they are inconvenient. We will repeal a number of laws that restrict these (like mass surveillance), and codify basic rights into a simple constitution for the UK.  

There's lots more, of course. Take a look at the [manifesto](/manifesto) for the whole lot.

## The Party

### Why didn't you join another party; why make a new one?

None of the existing parties really represent what we want to be, and what we think is unique about us. While we have big areas of overlap in policy with many existing parties, at our core is openness. Existing parties are often more like tribes, fighting the enemy within and without, whereas we want to be about openness and consensus from day one. We want to show that politics can be done differently, and so we've been 100% open from the very beginning, and always will be.

Most of UK politics works on structures from the Industrial Revolution; we are a party built for the Network Revolution, a truly modern choice without the baggage of old labels.

We also have a bit of a startup mentality; if you had an idea for a new product, would you join a huge company and try to convince them to make it, or would you start something yourself and disrupt the market from below? We know which we'd choose.

### If politics is broken, why make a party at all?

Thereâ€™s an old joke about a driver lost in the countryside. She sees a local, and stops to ask directions to her destination. The local resident says "Hmm, well, if I were you, I wouldnâ€™t start from here".

Something New believes in a future where we can evolve past our current representative democracy, with its tribes and antagonism. However, we also know that that will take a long time - we, as a society, aren't ready yet. There is a lot of work to do before we can offer direct democracy to all, and a lot of problems to solve. So, we're starting from here; in the system we have now, as a party, standing for election, and trying to move things towards a future where the party doesn't have to exist.

### Aren't small parties pointless?

The UK electoral system doesn't work for small parties *at all*. However, all new movements start small, and though it can take many years, everything has to start somewhere. There is a movement towards better democracy happening all over the world, and that movement will only grow. As well as building our own base, we also want to work with other parties to build that movement. We don't yet know who has the right answer, who will resonate best with the public. We'll find that out through experimentation, and this is ours.

The other reason to have a small party is to do things the large ones can't do, and show that it's possible. For instance, we make our policy 100% openly, we publish all our finances openly, and will soon be publishing an archive of all our promotional materials openly. These are better ways for parties of all sizes to operate, and we can show how by doing it.

## Manifesto  
  
### Other parties make policy openly - how are you different?

Most parties will say that their policy platform is open, that anyone can get involved. And that's true to an extent; you just need to pay a membership fee, propose policy to the annual conference (and attend), then if approved, trust someone to actually write it into the manifesto for you.

With ours, if you have an idea, you can click a button, write it in, and after a week of voting it could well be policy. As long as you've got access to the Internet, you can take part. It's a *little bit* easier.

### Why are the party and the manifesto separate things?

This is probably the most unusual thing about us. Most simply, it's because the manifesto existed before the party, as the [OpenPolitics project](https://openpolitics.org.uk), and we haven't yet decided to merge the two. There are a lot of people in common - the leaders of the OpenPolitics project are also the leaders of Something New, but not everyone is involved in both. Certainly, not all the authors of the manifesto are members of Something New.

The open manifesto is an attempt to create a political platform through consensus and open democracy. This party is a way to deliver that to voters through current electoral system, and a way to build up a political brand that can have some appeal.

Having a little separation is also a statement of our rock-solid belief in openness. The manifesto is an open project that is built by anyone in the UK, or even the world; anyone can get involved and build that platform. We trust that open collaboration can produce something like this, so much so that we as a party place our trust in the process, separate from ourselves. The manifesto also isn't tied to one party, it's available for anyone to stand on as an independent, or even for other parties to adopt.

Of course, we're also agile, so this might change in future. See the next question for the conditions under which that might happen.

### Can't someone come and take over your manifesto?

Yes and no. Everyone who gets something accepted into the manifesto gets to vote on future additions. That means that getting a vote is pretty easy. In theory a load of people could come along, make sensible changes, and then propose something terrible and brigade it in. 

However, under the current voting system, it's a lot easier to reject changes than get them accepted. Every voter can use a *block* vote, which is 1000x more powerful than a simple downvote, and which can be used where changes violate the principles of the manifesto. If someone tried to take over, I have no doubt the blocks would come out in force. But, this is experimental, so of course we don't *really* know yet.

What we can guarantee is this: today, the core principles of the open manifesto and the party are the same. If they ever diverge, the open-source nature of the manifesto means that party can (and will) take a copy of the manifesto and carry on with its own version under the same rules.

## Getting involved

### That all sounds great! How do I join? How can I help?

We don't have a proper membership scheme up and running yet, though we will soon, and it will be free to join. 

In the meantime, visit our ["get involved"](/support.html) page to find out how to join our [open forum](https://discourse.somethingnew.org.uk) and mailing list. We also depend on donations, so if you want to support our work that way, you can set up a payment via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=CFGWER8JJ738U). Again, more options coming soon.

### I think I love you.

That's not a question, but thank you! ðŸ˜Š
