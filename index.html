  Our old political options are broken, and we need new choices for the 21st century. We are
  a new political party that's all about working towards a better future for everyone, 
  built on openness, collaboration and the power of the Internet to connect us all.
</p>

<p>
  We started in 2013 by creating an <a href='/manifesto'>open-source manifesto</a>, 
  and now we're building a movement for a new type of democracy. 
  If that sounds like something you can believe in, join the party today!

  Be part of a better future. Be part of Something New.
