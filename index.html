The UK has voted to leave the EU. We don't think that was the right choice. Instead we think the future is
about love, tolerance, working together, and properly solving global challenges.
</p>

<p>
  Our old political options are broken, and we need new choices for the 21st century. We want to build
  a new political party that's all about working towards a better future, built on openness, collaboration and
  the power of the Internet to connect us all.
</p>

<p>
  We started by creating an open manifesto and standing in the 2015 election, but we need your help.
