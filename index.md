# Bringing British democracy into the 21st century.

{% include youtube.html id="Q88X6gMEdqc" %}

We are building a brighter future for everyone, where we can all have a say in how we run our society.

We believe in:

* optimism; we will make a better future by working together
* true democracy; where everyone's input is taken into account
* rational decision making based on sound evidence
* decentralised power and control
* working together as a species to solve the really big problems
* civil liberties and human rights; the marks of a civilised society
* public ownership of essential services and assets
* the elimination of poverty and want, through strong social safety nets

We stand candidates for election, to change the system from the inside, on an [open manifesto](http://openpolitics.org.uk/manifesto) that **you** can contribute to. It will be a long and hard fight, but everything worthwhile always is.

Be part of a better future. Be part of Something New.
