We think political parties should be open to fresh thinking and ideas. That's why we've helped build a completely open and non-partisan [manifesto](http://www.openpolitics.org.uk) that anyone can edit, and we hope you'll add your thoughts to it. If you'd like to [get involved](http://www.somethingnew.org.uk/volunteer) in other ways - even better! But if you have any questions you'd like to ask us in the meantime, then we can be reached:
