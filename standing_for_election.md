## What to do if you want to be a candidate for Something New?

Great! You've taken the first step towards building a better democracy. You can stand just for Something New, or you can dual-ticket with one of our [allies](http://www.somethingnew.org.uk/party_alliances), if you're a member of more than one party, for instance.

## Where?

The first thing to consider is where you want to be a candidate. Our general advice is that it is usually easier to be a candidate where you live. You know the area well, it’s easier for you to knock on doors, deliver leaflets and for you to attend meetings that you are invited to. It also helps you keep in touch with anyone who decides to volunteer to help you and it reassures voters that you have a personal connection with the area.

## At what level?

In 2015 there will be a General Election to the House of Commons and we are definitely looking for candidates who want to challenge a Member of Parliament. However, there are also council and local mayoral elections in many parts of the country. You might want to stand for one of these posts instead.

As a campaign, there’s a strategic advantage to having candidates at multiple levels on the same day. If your city had a Something New mayoral candidate, three Something New parliamentary candidates and 20 or so local council candidates, you would be developing a critical mass of campaigning activity in the local area as well as public awareness and credibility for the party, all of which are essential to winning people’s votes. It also means your campaign spending can be more cost effective.

The reality of the First Past the Post electoral system is that we are unlikely to get many candidates elected at any level – though it is possible. Our strategy in 2015 is to maximise the share of the vote as a starting platform for future elections. So you might want to pick an area to be a candidate because you would like to win a seat there in the future when the chances are better. But if you know of others in your area who might want to be candidates, then it would make sense to “cluster” your candidacies geographically and, if possible, overlay them at different levels.

If you get elected, we’ll be on hand to guide you through how to be a public representative and find the right training, support and mentorship for you.

## What will it cost?

We don’t want anyone to feel they can’t be a Something New candidate due to cost. To contest the seat of an MP, the minimum we will need to raise is about £2,000. £500 is the deposit, which is returned if you get 5% of the vote or more, and £1,500 is about the minimum you can reasonably spend on leaflets.

What we want from you is your commitment to help us raise this £2,000 and to win more than 5% of the vote. When you express your interest we want your plan on how you would fundraise £2,000\. We’ll help you as much as we can in improving and implementing your plan. You don’t need to have the money up front.

If you want to stand for a council seat, there’s no deposit but the leaflets will cost up to £300\. Again we’d want your plan on how this is raised. Mayoral elections and other posts have different levels but are usually more than the costs of standing for parliament.

For all candidates, we will help you set up a website that links into our campaigning system, and this will have a donate button that will enable people to donate through Paypal. We’ll have a central bank account but will log if a donation is designated for your campaign. We will also help you comply with election spending rules.

## What help do I get on policy?

We are open minded on policy. We won’t try to force you to support or oppose a specific policy, however, there are two forms of help we will give you.

Firstly, there is our [open manifesto](/manifesto/). This is an open space where you can choose policies you like and help develop and improve policies. The only commitment you have is to conform to our values.

Secondly, we will choose some of these – or some other policies – to lead on nationally. Normally we will be choosing our national “manifesto” policies for strategic reasons. This will be either to reinforce in the public mind what our values are or to differentiate us from other political parties - and of course to win publicity.

We will ask you to support our national policies and to implement them on your local microsite, but we won’t demand you support anything you’re not comfortable with. And if you have a policy proposal that meets our needs, we’ll potentially adopt it into our national framework.

If you are elected you will be expected to use your judgment on which way to vote on a policy. We only insist that in using your judgement, you conform to our shared values. But you can always talk to us when making up your mind! While we may have a number of policies adopted nationally, you should think not just about which policies you agree with most but also which would be most beneficial to the people you hope to represent.

## What time will being a candidate take?

The 2015 elections are on 7th May and you have to think about what you will do before and around then. In many ways that’s up to you but the more volunteers who help you, the more tasks you will be able to delegate. Some of these tasks will be.

*   Responding to emails from voters
*   Attending meetings with local community groups and journalists
*   Attending hustings meetings (public debates)
*   Meeting with and encouraging your local volunteer supporters
*   Meeting with the local council Electoral Registration Officers
*   Delivering leaflets
*   Knocking on doors and asking voters for their support
*   Street stalls handing out leaflets and meeting voters
*   Polling day
*   The count
*   Completing the election expenses return

You don’t have to do all of these things and we can advise you on making the best of your time. But if you have a good team of volunteers you can do all this and more. Being a local council candidate generally requires much less time than being a parliamentary candidate.

If you can spend 8 hours a week on this, that’s a good start. In the last month, many parliamentary candidates take some time off work. The count is often on the Thursday night (potentially all night) and sometimes deferred to the Friday daytime.

## What if more than one person wants a particular candidacy?

If you and one other person (or more) both want a candidacy for the same seat, we will first look for a negotiated position where you are standing in neighbouring seats or overlapping at different levels so that you can support each other easily and effectively.

Where a council has multi-member wards and there’s more than one council seat available in a ward, we will generally advise only one candidate standing in that ward to “focus” the votes of supporters on one candidate. But this isn’t a rule and there are other advantages in having multiple candidates in a ward – including having shared costs and workload.

If two or more candidates want to contest a selection, we will hold a selection meeting of local supporters, though we may ask you to help fundraise for the costs of this democratic selection process. In future elections we will be aiming to hold open primary elections so that a wide body of local people can have a stake.

## What restrictions are there on being a candidate for Something New?

As we mentioned before, our values are at the heart of our mission. We want all politicians to be driven by their values and to be honest about them and we aim to lead by example. We want this from you.

We ask that you sign up to support our values in full, that you do your best to be professional, hard-working and respectful to others in the course of your campaign, that you comply with election, data protection and equalities laws (we’ll help with this) and that you don’t bring yourself or Something New into disrepute. If you don’t support our values then we ask that you don’t seek to be a candidate for us (though we hope you will still support us if you think our values overlap sufficiently).

Other than that, we have no restrictions, but we also want our candidates to illustrate our values. We particularly encourage candidacies from people with disabilities, young people, women, people whose sexual preferences were once illegal and in fact anyone who feels shut out by the political process as it is.
