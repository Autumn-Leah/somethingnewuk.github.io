## Join the movement

To make a better future, we need to build alliances, and to pull together a wider movement.

We want to work closely with other parties who share [our values](our_values). If you want to be an ally, here's what it means:

1. On our site, we list any allied parties or independents, with logos on the front page, and a full list here.
2. On our ["how to stand"](/standing_for_election) page, we also list any allied parties. Candidates can choose to dual-ticket with any of them, if they want to.
3. On our [candidates](candidates) page, we include details of dual-ticketed candidates with the other party listed. We will also suggest that if there isn't a Something New candidate local to our supporters, that they look at allied parties as well.
4. We collaborate strongly with allied parties, bringing them into our comms channels and letting them see our organisational plans.
5. We will share supporter lists where possible, while always respecting our supporters' privacy and making sure they're informed

If this sounds like something you'd like to do, and your values match [ours](our_values), then [get in touch](mailto:info@somethingnew.org.uk) to start the discussion!
